# Sports-Data-Analytics-Scraper
This project was for our NETS 150 final project and was completed by Ryan L., Sean C., and me. The analytics scraper utilizes Java's JSoup and Regex packages to scrape data from popular sports data websites and returns specific statistics based on user inputs. We can scrape statistics for all NFL, NBA, and MLB players to ever exist and we return the key statistics in a visualizer provided in the visualizer.java file. 

To run this application, you must first install JSoup. Then in our command prompt, you will be asked to input a sport and can choose from the above mentioned sports. Next, you are prompted to type in a player name and once submitted, you will be returned a new JFrame panel with key statistics of that player.
